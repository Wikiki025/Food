<summary>How to cook?</summary>
<b>1.Wash fish clean; rub with fish sauce and some salt.</b><br>
Cut the fish into three pieces and put them in a pot with some lemon grass stalks. You donâ€™t have to put water. Or just add a bit of water. When the fish is cooked enough to flake off easily, put it down. Take out flesh and set it aside. Take out the fish bones and pound them. When you pound the bones, put some water, so as to get some fish stock out of the bones. You can throw the bones away when there is no fish stock to get out of the bones.<br>
<b>2. Cut about 15 rings of the onions into thin slices, fry them and take out from the oil after you get a reddish brown color.</b><br>
Do not throw away the oil.<br>
<b>3. Cut the rest of the onions into four pieces.</b><br>
<b>
4. Pound ginger, some onions and garlic as required amount.</b><br>
<b>
5. Heat the oil that you fried the onions with.</b><br>
<b>6. Then add the gram flour (Bean Powder), rice powder in water into the pot.</b><br>
Stir well to prevent sticking of paste.<br>
<b>
7. When it starts to boil,add the flaked fish now. Add fish sauce/shrimp sauce to taste.</b><br>
<b>8. When the mo-hinga soup is cooked, put the pot on low heat.</b><br>
<b>Ready To eat!</b>
